# This package provides the API layer for the God Mode system.

"""
This module makes the ``api`` directory a Python package so that its
submodules can be imported using standard dotted module paths. It can also
hold common initialization logic for the API components if needed.

Currently this file is empty because the repository’s API layer is still
under development. Future versions may expose package-level imports or
configuration here.
