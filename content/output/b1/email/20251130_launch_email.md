**Subject:** Get the AI playbook we actually run (48h founder price)

Hey {{first_name}},

You’ve seen the HUD screenshots and autopilot logs I keep dropping. The truth is boring: it’s all powered by a Notion + prompt stack we’ve been refining for months.

Instead of rebuilding it from scratch, you can copy the entire thing:

- 30+ Notion dashboards for funnels, content, partner outreach, and finance.
- Prompt packs for shorts, LinkedIn, email, affiliate pitches, and nurture flows.
- Autopilot-ready SOPs so your agent can execute without babysitting.
- A launch checklist we literally run internally (with guardrails + roadmaps).

Need more time? Drop your email on the landing page and we’ll send the one-page launch checklist anyway. But the founder price disappears in 48 hours.

Let me know if you want to see a Loom walkthrough before grabbing it.
