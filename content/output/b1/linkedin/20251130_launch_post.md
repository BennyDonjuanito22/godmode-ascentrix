**Headline:** I stopped rebuilding funnels every week. Here’s the toolkit we use now.

Last month I realized we’d rebuilt the same AI funnel 4 times:

1. Map the offer in Notion.
2. Write short-form hooks + emails.
3. Build a HUD so agents can see revenue + tasks.
4. Pray Autopilot remembers the SOP.

So I froze the most recent build, cleaned it up, and turned it into a toolkit:

- 30+ Notion dashboards (funnels, finances, partner CRM, content calendar).
- Prompt packs for shorts, LinkedIn, outreach, and nurture.
- An Autopilot-ready launch checklist with guardrails.
- Scripts to record revenue + leads automatically.

Now I duplicate the workspace, drop in the new offer, and let Autopilot run the roadmap. No more “new doc, who dis?”

I bundled everything we ship internally as the **AI Growth Toolkit**. Founder price is live for 48 hours if you want it:

Not ready? Throw your email on the landing page and I’ll send the launch checklist anyway.

PS: If you run a newsletter or creator community, DM me for an affiliate link. I’ve already got the rev-share tracking set up.
