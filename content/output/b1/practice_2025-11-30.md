# Promoter Practice – 2025-11-30

## New Hooks / Copy Variants
1. **Hook: "The dashboard that does your launch for you"**  
   - Short-form line: "I stopped rebuilding funnels because this Notion + prompt stack literally runs the launch for me. Want the same dashboard?"  
   - CTA snippet: "Grab the AI Growth Toolkit (founder price) here → https://godmode.gumroad.com/l/aigrowthtoolkit"
2. **Hook: "Agents doing daily drills"**  
   - Short-form line: "Imagine your AI agents have a daily checklist: learn, secure, ship. That's exactly how we built the AI Growth Toolkit. Link in bio."  
   - CTA snippet: "Meet the toolkit + SOPs we use internally → https://godmode.gumroad.com/l/aigrowthtoolkit"
3. **Hook: "Clone our 5 marketplace listings"**  
   - Short-form line: "We list the same AI toolkit on Gumroad, Lemon, Etsy without rewriting copy. Want the kit + checklist?"  
   - CTA snippet: "Download the marketplace kit bundle → https://godmode.gumroad.com/l/aigrowthtoolkit"

## CTA / Funnel Audit
- Current primary CTA: `https://godmode.gumroad.com/l/aigrowthtoolkit`
- Lead capture: `/funnels/b1/lead` writing to `finance/leads.jsonl` (verified via scripts/lead_pipeline.py output).
- Nurture follow-up: `python3 scripts/nurture_leads.py send --limit 25` with template stored in `content/output/b1/short_form_scripts.md`.
- Needed before publishing: replace the test Stripe link with the production checkout URL and update docs/b1_promo_log.md rows with actual post URLs + metrics.

## Next Moves
- Record real performance data (views, CTR) per hook once published.
- Repurpose these hooks into Gumroad/Lemon Squeezy copy using docs/b1_multiplatform_kit.md so every listing shares the same positioning.
