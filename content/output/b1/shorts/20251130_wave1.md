# B1 Promo – Shorts Wave 1 (Launch Day)

## Hook 1 – “Weekend Build”
- **Opening (0:00-0:03)**: “I just built a $200/day AI funnel… in a weekend.”
- **Middle (0:03-0:12)**: Screen recordings of the Notion HQ + autopilot log. Narrate: “The AI Growth Toolkit hands you the Notion dashboards, prompt packs, and launch SOPs we run internally. I clicked ‘duplicate’, fed it my niche, and Autopilot handled the rest.”
- **CTA (0:12-0:15)**: “Grab every template + SOP at the link in bio. Limited founder price.”
- **Overlay text**: “Toolkit + Prompts + SOPs → link in bio”.

## Hook 2 – “Stop Copy/Pasting”
- **Opening**: “Still rewriting the same captions and emails?”
- **Middle**: “The toolkit ships with 40+ battle-tested prompts (shorts, partner outreach, nurture sequences). Drop in your offer specifics and let the agent fire.”
- **CTA**: “Get the bundle + launch checklist — link in bio / pinned comment.”
- **Asset needs**: B-roll of HUD, screenshots of prompt pack, quick ledger footage.

## Hook 3 – “Agent POV”
- **Opening**: “POV: your AI agent already has instructions for your funnel.”
- **Middle**: Show autopilot log excerpt with guardrails. Narration: “Instead of babysitting runs, I point our agents at the ready-made roadmap inside the toolkit. They build the HUD, funnels, and follow-ups while I sleep.”
- **CTA**: “Toolkit drops this week. Grab it before price unlocks.”
- **Reminder**: Mention the lead magnet (email follow-up) for viewers not ready to buy.
