# God Mode Design Docs

This folder (`design_docs/`) is where the God Mode architecture, system design plans,
and related documentation should be stored.

The build agent (`GodModeAgent`) uses the `search_design_docs` tool to search within
this directory for relevant context about how the system is supposed to behave and
which components still need to be implemented or updated.
