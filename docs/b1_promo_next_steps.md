# B1 Promo Sprint Next Steps

## Overview
The B1 promo sprint assets have been drafted and logged with placeholders for URLs, publish timestamps, and performance metrics. The next phase involves publishing these assets on the respective platforms and updating the promo log accordingly.

## Publishing Steps

1. **TikTok and Shorts**
   - Use the short-form scripts in `content/output/b1/short_form_scripts.md`.
   - Record the published video URLs.
   - Update `docs/b1_promo_log.md` with URLs, publish timestamps, and initial view metrics.

2. **LinkedIn**
   - Post the carousel/thread posts using the LinkedIn scripts.
   - Capture the post URLs.
   - Update the promo log with URLs, timestamps, and engagement metrics.

3. **Email**
   - Send the teaser and last-chance email blasts using the templates.
   - Track open rates and click-through rates.
   - Update the promo log accordingly.

4. **CTA Link**
   - Confirm the refreshed CTA link is live and consistent across all assets.
   - Replace all `[CTA Link]` placeholders with the actual URL before publishing.

5. **Tracking and Metrics**
   - Monitor views, opens, CTRs, and replies.
   - Regularly update `docs/b1_promo_log.md` with performance data.

## Notes
- Ensure messaging consistency and no upsells as per the sprint plan.
- Use the outreach DM template for personalized follow-ups.
