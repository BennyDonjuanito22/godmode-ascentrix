# B3 Traffic Research – Emerging Opportunities

## Goal
Identify at least three high-leverage traffic sources/collaborations for the AI Hustle content engine so we can grow top-of-funnel reach and feed B1/B2 offers.

## 1. TikTok Creative Challenge (beta)
- **Why**: TikTok now rewards creators for prompt-based “creative challenges” tied to sponsored themes. These challenges heavily favor AI/automation niches.
- **Plan**:
  - Monitor `https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/creative-center` for new briefs mentioning AI/automation.
  - Submit “AI hustle” clips tailored to each challenge; include CTA to link-in-bio landing page.
  - Track payouts + views in `content/output/b3/challenges.csv`.
- **Next Step**: Research top-performing sound trends weekly and log them in memory.

## 2. YouTube Shorts Search Clips
- **Why**: YouTube recently surfaced Shorts in traditional search results for “how to…” queries. Targeting evergreen search intent can drive consistent traffic.
- **Plan**:
  - Build a list of 20 evergreen prompts (e.g., “how to automate lead gen with AI”).
  - Produce Shorts optimized for captions + on-screen text to capture search keywords.
  - Link to long-form video or newsletter for deeper nurture.
- **Next Step**: Add “search-focused” tag to scripts stored in `content/output/b3/`.

## 3. LinkedIn Newsletter / Collaborative Posts
- **Why**: LinkedIn newsletters trigger notifications for every subscriber and perform well for B2B/creator audiences. Cross-posting summaries from the AI Hustle channel extends reach.
- **Plan**:
  - Launch a weekly LinkedIn newsletter repurposing the week’s best scripts and linking to B1/B2 CTAs.
  - Invite micro-influencers to co-author certain issues (exposes us to their network).
  - Track subscriber growth and referral sources in a Notion/CSV log.
- **Next Step**: Draft template issue (intro, top playbooks, CTA) and store in `businesses/b3_content_engine/`.

## Action Items
1. Schedule recurring researcher task to refresh this list monthly (add/update opportunities).
2. Log experiments + metrics via `memory/notes.jsonl` (tag `stream:B3`).
3. Update `businesses/b3_content_engine/copy.json` once new channels prove out.
