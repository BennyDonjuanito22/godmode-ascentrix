### Prioritization Notes
1. **Phase 1** – Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy, Etsy: minimal friction, best ROI for digital kits.
2. **Phase 2** – AppSumo + Notion directories: larger lifts but huge visibility.
3. **Phase 3** – Udemy/Thinkific course conversion + service marketplaces (Fiverr/Upwork) for B4 upsells.
