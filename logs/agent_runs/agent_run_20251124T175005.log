GOAL: Implement a minimal financial logging mechanism so that revenue per day and per funnel can be tracked. You may use a JSONL ledger under 'finance/ledger.jsonl' or a simple table in Postgres, whichever you can fully implement now. Provide a small script or API endpoint to append entries with timestamp, amount, currency, source/funnel, and notes, and document how to use it.
