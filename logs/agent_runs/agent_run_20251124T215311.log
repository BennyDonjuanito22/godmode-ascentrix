GOAL: Using 'design_docs/dashboard_spec.md', implement or refine the core HUD screens in the existing HUD/frontend code: Home/Overview, Streams/Businesses, Agents, and Logs/Memory. It is acceptable to use placeholder/static data as long as navigation and layout match the spec. Document which files you changed in the spec or in a new doc if needed.
