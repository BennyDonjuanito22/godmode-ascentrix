GOAL: Build a reusable template under 'businesses/' that defines structure, copy blocks, assets, and deployment steps for revenue funnels. B1-B4 should each reference this template to speed replication.
=== NEW RUN 20251124T234225 ===
GOAL: Extend autopilot so it can schedule builder, fixer, researcher, and promoter agents with unique guardrails and retry policies. Update docs to describe how new agent types are configured and launched.
