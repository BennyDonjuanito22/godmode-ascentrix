=== NEW RUN 20251125T043355 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Update hud/index.html so all widgets fetch data from /hud/home, /hud/streams, /hud/agents, /hud/logs, and /hud/settings instead of placeholders. Ensure the UI handles loading/error states gracefully.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (builder): Ship working code/docs tied to the goal. Write tests when possible and update relevant specs before finishing.

{"thought":"First, I will locate and read the hud/index.html file to understand the current widget data fetching implementation and placeholders. Then, I will identify how the widgets fetch data and where to update the URLs to the new endpoints: /hud/home, /hud/streams, /hud/agents, /hud/logs, and /hud/settings. I will also check if there is existing code handling loading and error states or if I need to add that. After that, I will verify if the backend endpoints exist or if I need to check their implementation to ensure the frontend can fetch data from them.
