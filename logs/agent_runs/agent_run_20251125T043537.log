=== NEW RUN 20251125T043537 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Replace the placeholder bag-of-words embeddings with a Qdrant-backed pipeline (or best available vector DB) so /memory/search returns higher-quality results. Document configuration and update docs/vector_memory.md accordingly.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (builder): Ship working code/docs tied to the goal. Write tests when possible and update relevant specs before finishing.

{"thought":"First, I will locate the current implementation of the placeholder bag-of-words embeddings used for /memory/search. I will search the repository for 'bag-of-words' or 'embedding' to find the relevant code. Then, I will check the design_docs/vector_memory.md to understand the current documentation and see how to update it after the change. Once I identify the current embedding pipeline, I will plan the integration of Qdrant or the best available vector DB for higher-quality vector search. After that, I will update the /memory/search endpoint to use the new vector DB pipeline and write tests and documentation accordingly.","tool":"search_repo","tool_input":"bag-of-words embedding"}
