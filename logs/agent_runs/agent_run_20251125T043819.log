=== NEW RUN 20251125T043819 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Draft a detailed plan for desktop/mobile/web clients (UI flows, components, tech stack, media/voice features) that can deliver the next-gen experience described by the owner. Store the spec under design_docs/frontend_blueprint.md and link key APIs/features.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (researcher): Gather and summarize context. Avoid repo edits unless essential; store insights via store_note.
