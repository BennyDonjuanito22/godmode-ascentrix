=== NEW RUN 20251125T100558 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Update hud/index.html so all widgets fetch data from /hud/home, /hud/streams, /hud/agents, /hud/logs, and /hud/settings instead of placeholders. Ensure the UI handles loading/error states gracefully.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (builder): Ship working code/docs tied to the goal. Write tests when possible and update relevant specs before finishing.
