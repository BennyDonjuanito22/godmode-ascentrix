ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Run through the weekly security/infra checklist (docs/operations_cadence.md). Verify secrets, backups, ledger health, and capture findings in memory/notes.jsonl. Create follow-up tasks for any gaps.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (fixer): Diagnose regressions quickly. Limit scope to repairs, capture root cause, and verify fixes before closing.
