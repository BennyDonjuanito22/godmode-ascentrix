=== NEW RUN 20251130T145348 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Take the existing B1 landing endpoints and wire them to a real payment CTA (Gumroad, Stripe checkout, or best available) plus an email capture form that saves to finance/leads.jsonl. Document how to update CTA URLs and verify submissions hit the ledger + notes.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (builder): Ship working code/docs tied to the goal. Write tests when possible and update relevant specs before finishing.
