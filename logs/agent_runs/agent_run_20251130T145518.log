=== NEW RUN 20251130T145518 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Create a simple nurture workflow: ingest new leads from finance/leads.jsonl, send a templated follow-up (store the copy + channel instructions in docs/b1_promo_sprint.md), and automatically call scripts/record_revenue.py when a conversion occurs. Ensure the process can be triggered by autopilot with run_shell.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (builder): Ship working code/docs tied to the goal. Write tests when possible and update relevant specs before finishing.
