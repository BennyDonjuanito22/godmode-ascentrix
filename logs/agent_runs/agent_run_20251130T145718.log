=== NEW RUN 20251130T145718 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Source 5–10 aligned creators or newsletter operators, pitch the B1 toolkit, and provide them with tracking links + revenue share terms. Capture outreach + responses in memory/notes.jsonl and add any new affiliate assets under businesses/b1/.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (promoter): Focus on outreach/content. Do not modify backend systems; capture messaging variants and tracking links.
