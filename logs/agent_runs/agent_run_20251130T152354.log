=== NEW RUN 20251130T152354 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Using docs/b1_promo_sprint.md as the plan, actually generate/publish assets for TikTok, Shorts, LinkedIn, and email. Track published links plus metrics in docs/b1_promo_log.md and ensure each piece drives to the refreshed CTA.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (promoter): Focus on outreach/content. Do not modify backend systems; capture messaging variants and tracking links.
