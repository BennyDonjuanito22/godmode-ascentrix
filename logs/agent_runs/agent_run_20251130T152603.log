=== NEW RUN 20251130T152603 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Source 5–10 aligned creators or newsletter operators, pitch the B1 toolkit, and provide them with tracking links + revenue share terms. Capture outreach + responses in memory/notes.jsonl and add any new affiliate assets under businesses/b1/.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (promoter): Focus on outreach/content. Do not modify backend systems; capture messaging variants and tracking links.

TOOL_RESULT: {'content': '# God Mode Businesses & Money Streams Plan\n\n## Overview\n\nGod Mode will incubate multiple income streams in parallel, continuously measuring ROI and redirecting effort toward the best-performing funnels. This document defines the initial streams **B1–B4**, specifying their offers, audiences, traffic plans, supporting automations, and KPIs. Agents must read and update this plan before touching any funnel so changes remain coordinated across HUD, docs, and memory.\n\nThe existing HUD remains the canonical UI for surfacing stream KPIs and controls. If a new HUD is ever introduced, it must provide equivalent or better visibility before the old interface is deprecated.\n\n---\n\n## B1 – Affiliate / Digital Product Funnel\n\n**Type:** Affiliate promotion or internally produced digital product bundle  \n**Goal:** Generate fast cash flow with minimal infrastructure\n\n### Offer & Positioning\n- Curated “AI Growth Toolkit” (Notion templates, prompt packs, SOP checklists). Bundle can be swapped for an affiliate offer if better economics appear.\n- Price point: $37–$97 (or commission-based for affiliate).\n\n### Target Audience\n- Solopreneurs, creators, and agencies seeking AI leverage without deep technical skills.\n- Pain points: wasted time on manual content, uncertainty about AI workflows.\n\n### Traffic & Acquisition\n- Short-form content (TikTok, IG Reels, YT Shorts) highlighting quick wins.\n- Lead magnet optional: “5 prompts that add $1k/mo.”\n- CTA flows to landing page hosted within HUD/API or external checkout.\n\n### Funnel Experience\n1. Short-form post → Link-in-bio → Landing page.\n2. Landing page elements:\n   - Hero copy with succinct ROI promise.\n   - Video/social proof block (can be placeholder initially).\n   - CTA button with `affiliate_url` or internal checkout link.\n3. Post-purchase email (optional) delivered by external tool.\n\n### Automations & Support\n- `scripts/record_revenue.py` (future) logs conversions against B1.\n- HUD Streams page uses `/hud/streams/<id>/revenue` to graph performance.\n- Content pipeline stored under `content/output/b1/`.\n\n### Initial KPIs & Targets\n- CAC: <$5 (organic), Conversion rate ≥ 2.5%.\n- Daily revenue target: $200/day by day 30.\n- Content cadence: 3–5 short-form posts/day.\n\n### Immediate Agent Tasks\n- Build landing page or API endpoint with placeholders for hero copy, CTA URL, and testimonial block.\n- Document configuration in `docs/revenue_funnel_1.md`, including:\n  - How to swap affiliate URL / product link.\n  - Where to edit copy and imagery.\n- Seed ledger entry examples for B1 in finance docs.\n- Execute promo blitz per `docs/b1_promo_sprint.md` when traffic needs a surge.\n\n---\n\n## B2 – Ecommerce Micro-Store (Holiday Spike)\n\n**Type:** Seasonal micro-store (print-on-demand or dropship)  \n**Goal:** Capture holiday or event-driven demand with focused offers\n\n### Offer & Positioning\n- Limited collection of 3–10 SKUs tied to upcoming seasonal hooks (e.g., “AI-generated cozy holiday posters” or “Custom AI pet ornaments”).\n- Scarcity messaging (“Only available this season”).\n\n### Target Audience\n- Gift buyers looking for unique, personalized items.\n- Sub-niches: pet owners, gamers, tech enthusiasts.\n\n### Traffic & Acquisition\n- Organic social + Pinterest boards with lifestyle mockups.\n- Retargeting ads (Meta/TikTok) once pixels accumulate data.\n- Partnerships with micro-influencers offering discount codes.\n\n### Funnel Experience\n1. Content/ads → Storefront (Shopify / Printful embed).\n2. Category page grouped by persona (pets, tech, etc.).\n3. Product pages highlight personalization + shipping deadlines.\n4. Checkout and follow-up handled by external platform, but HUD should display high-level metrics.\n\n### Automations & Support\n- Document store architecture and integration steps in `docs/ecom_store_plan.md`.\n- Sync daily revenue/orders into ledger via API or CSV import script.\n- HUD should ingest order counts and revenue via `/hud/streams/b2/revenue`.\n\n### KPIs & Targets\n- Conversion rate ≥ 3% (warm traffic).\n- AOV ≥ $40, Net margin ≥ 25%.\n- Break-even ad spend within 48 hours during peak week.\n\n### Immediate Agent Tasks\n- Propose SKU shortlist with mock copy/images (stored under `businesses/b2/skus.json` or similar).\n- Define fulfillment workflow (print-on-demand provider, shipping timelines).\n- Outline ad/creative brief templates.\n\n---\n\n## B3 – Content-Driven Funnel (Audience Engine)\n\n**Type:** Media + lead funnel driving traffic to B1/B2  \n**Goal:** Own distribution and reduce acquisition cost\n\n### Offer & Positioning\n- Daily “AI Hustle” channel delivering actionable playbooks.\n- Email newsletter or Discord community as retention layer.\n\n### Target Audience\n- Aspiring online earners, side hustlers, indie hackers.\n- Pain points: information overload, desire for repeatable playbooks.\n\n### Traffic & Acquisition\n- Multi-platform content (TikTok, IG, YT Shorts, Twitter threads).\n- Link-in-bio page linking to B1 toolkit, B2 store, and newsletter sign-up.\n- Occasional collabs/interviews to expand reach.\n\n### Funnel Experience\n1. Content → Link-in-bio hub (hosted via simple page in HUD or external service).\n2. CTA buttons: “Get the toolkit (B1)”, “Shop the holiday store (B2)”, “Join newsletter”.\n3. Newsletter nurtures subscribers toward whichever funnel offers the best ROI that week.\n\n### Automations & Support\n- Store scripts, hooks, B-roll instructions under `content/output/b3/`.\n- Provide template scheduler (CSV/Notion) that autopilot can update.\n- Use `memory/notes.jsonl` to log content experiments and performance.\n\n### KPIs & Targets\n- Daily content count: ≥5 pieces.\n- CTR from bio page ≥ 12%.\n- Newsletter subscriber growth ≥ 100/day once pipeline is steady.\n\n### Immediate Agent Tasks\n- Create `docs/content_pipeline.md` with step-by-step workflow (ideation → scripting → production → posting).\n- Build a lightweight link-in-bio page referencing B1/B2.\n- Define naming/tagging conventions for content assets.\n- Refresh channel research monthly (see `docs/b3_traffic_research.md` for current ideas).\n\n---\n\n## B4 – Service-Style AI Offer\n\n**Type:** Done-for-you or DFY/DWY hybrid service (AI content, AI lead-gen, automation builds)  \n**Goal:** Capture higher-ticket revenue with relatively low volume\n\n### Offer & Positioning\n- “AI Content Sprint”: deliver 30 pieces of SEO-ready or short-form content within 72 hours using God Mode’s tooling.\n- Tiered packages (Starter $499, Growth $1,499, Custom $3k+).\n\n### Target Audience\n- Agencies, local businesses, and influencers needing large content batches quickly.\n- Pain points: inconsistent freelancers, slow manual processes.\n\n### Traffic & Acquisition\n- Direct outreach via email/LinkedIn leveraging case studies.\n- Lead capture through landing page and Calendly-style booking.\n- Cross-sell from B1/B3 (“Need us to do it for you? Book a sprint.”).\n\n### Funnel Experience\n1. Landing page outlines offer, timeline, sample deliverables, testimonials (can start as placeholders).\n2. Intake form gathers niche, tone, deliverable types.\n3. Payment link (Stripe invoice or similar).\n4. Delivery occurs via shared folder + recap email.\n\n### Automations & Support\n- Document the production workflow in `docs/ai_service_offer.md`.\n- Add CRM-lite tracking (Coda/Notion or simple JSONL) for leads/progress.\n- Log service revenue in ledger with funnel tag `B4`.\n\n### KPIs & Targets\n- Close rate ≥ 20% on qualified leads.\n- Gross margin ≥ 60% after compute/tool costs.\n- Goal: 4+ sprints per month to hit $5k+ MRR.\n\n### Immediate Agent Tasks\n- Draft detailed SOP for fulfillment, including which agents/scripts produce deliverables.\n- Build or stub intake form in HUD/API.\n- Prepare outreach templates and store in `businesses/b4/outreach_templates.md`.\n\n---\n\n## Phase Priorities & Coordination\n\n1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4)** – Launch B1 (cashflow) and B3 (traffic). Objective: Validate toolkit/course offer and spin up an owned audience quickly.\n2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8)** – Layer in B2 (seasonal spike) and B4 (service upsell). Objective: Diversify revenue sources and raise AOV.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Every code/doc change touching a funnel must reference this plan and update it if assumptions change.\n- Store experimental results in `memory/notes.jsonl` tagged with `stream:B1`, `stream:B2`, etc.\n- HUD stream detail pages should mirror the structure above so operators always know offer, audience, traffic, tasks, and KPIs.\n\n---\n\n## Continuous Optimization & Innovation (AUTOGEN Requirement)\n\nFor each stream, agents must:\n\n1. **Review performance weekly**: ledger data, HUD metrics, notes, and design docs.\n2. **Propose optimizations**: copy tweaks, new hooks, fresh traffic channels, pricing tests, UX improvements.\n3. **Document changes**: log rationale in `memory/notes.jsonl` and update this plan or stream-specific docs (`revenue_funnel_1.md`, `ecom_store_plan.md`, etc.).\n4. **Automate learnings**: when a tactic works, encode it into scripts or templates so future runs can reproduce the result instantly.\n\nWhen a major pivot occurs (e.g., switching the B1 offer), agents must:\n- Update HUD labels and documentation.\n- Archive or annotate deprecated assets to avoid confusion.\n- Ensure autopilot roadmap tasks reflect the new objectives.\n'}
