=== NEW RUN 20251130T154900 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Create docs/b1_multiplatform_kit.md that packages copy blocks, image specs, pricing guidance, and UTM templates so we can publish the toolkit on Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy, Etsy, and other marketplaces without rewriting everything each time. Include platform-specific sections and checklist items.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (builder): Ship working code/docs tied to the goal. Write tests when possible and update relevant specs before finishing.
