=== NEW RUN 20251130T154930 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Research 15 digital marketplaces (Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy, Etsy, AppSumo, etc.) and summarize fees, payout schedules, file requirements, and promo levers in docs/marketplaces_research.md. Highlight which ones align with B1/B2/B3.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (researcher): Gather and summarize context. Avoid repo edits unless essential; store insights via store_note.
