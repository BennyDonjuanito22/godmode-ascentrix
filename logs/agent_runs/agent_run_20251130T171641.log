=== NEW RUN 20251130T171641 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Draft 3 new hooks/copy variants, audit CTA performance, save outputs to content/output/b1/practice_<date>.md per design_docs/agent_continuous_learning.md.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (promoter): Focus on outreach/content. Do not modify backend systems; capture messaging variants and tracking links.

TOOL_RESULT: {'content': '# Agent Continuous Learning Framework\n\nGoal: keep every autonomous agent sharp by reserving daily time for skill practice, security checks, and knowledge ingestion. This document defines the cadence and the tooling (see `scripts/schedule_skill_tasks.py`).\n\n## Daily Cadence (per agent type)\n| Agent | Practice Block | Security & QA | Knowledge Build | Output |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Builder | 1h – code kata / refactor exercise (pick from `/playground/katas`) | 30m – diff scan for regressions | 30m – read spec updates (`design_docs/*`) | `reports/builder_practice_<date>.md` |\n| Fixer | 45m – replay past incidents, simulate fixes | 45m – run smoke scripts (`scripts/check_ledger_health.py`, etc.) | 30m – read security advisories | `reports/fixer_practice_<date>.md` |\n| Researcher | 1h – new market sweep (follow Research Playbook) | 15m – validate cached sources still accurate | 45m – absorb notebooks/papers | `memory/notes.jsonl` entry + log |\n| Promoter | 1h – create new hooks/copy variants | 30m – audit CTA performance | 30m – study platform algorithm notes | `content/output/<stream>/practice_<date>.md` |\n| Autopilot Coordinator | 30m – run task-plan retro | 30m – security/self-test (simulate attacker mindset) | 30m – review design_docs roadmap updates | `logs/autopilot_runs/` note |\n\n## Mechanism\n1. `scripts/schedule_skill_tasks.py` appends daily practice tasks (one per agent type) to `api/tasks/roadmap.jsonl` with unique IDs + ISO date.\n2. Autopilot picks them up like any other task, ensuring every day includes non-revenue skill work.\n3. Each practice task references:\n   - This document for cadence.\n   - `design_docs/research_agent_playbook.md` for R&D loops.\n   - Katas/notes folder for exercises.\n4. Outputs (reports or notes) saved under `/reports/` (or respective folders) to create a time series of improvements.\n\n## Usage\n- Run `python3 scripts/schedule_skill_tasks.py --date YYYY-MM-DD` to generate tasks for that day (default = today).\n- Schedule the script via cron/Launchd to run every midnight so the roadmap is restocked automatically.\n- Autopilot logs should reflect practice results; manually review weekly to adjust focus areas.\n\n## Future Enhancements\n- Add performance scoring to each practice output to quantify improvement.\n- Tie into HUD (Settings > Agent Controls) so operators can adjust practice durations per agent type.\n- Expand kata library (`playground/katas/`) for builders/fixers.\n'}
