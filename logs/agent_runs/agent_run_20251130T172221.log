=== NEW RUN 20251130T172221 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Pick a new market hypothesis, apply design_docs/research_agent_playbook.md workflow, log summary + sources in memory/notes.jsonl with tags ['research','practice'].

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (researcher): Gather and summarize context. Avoid repo edits unless essential; store insights via store_note.

TOOL_RESULT: {'content': '# Research Agent Playbook\n\nThis playbook tells every builder/researcher agent how to run due diligence, collect data, and translate findings into trusted tasks. Autopilot should reference this file before executing R&D tickets.\n\n## Core Principles\n1. **Define the question clearly** – restate the objective, success criteria, and constraints (budget, time, target persona).\n2. **Layered sourcing**:\n   - Primary: official docs, pricing pages, investor decks.\n   - Secondary: analyst blogs, comparison posts, community answers.\n   - Tertiary: social chatter (Twitter/Reddit) for qualitative signals.\n3. **Triangulate** – never trust a single link. Capture at least two corroborating sources for claims (fees, timelines, conversion data).\n4. **Quantify + qualify** – pair numbers (CAGR, CPM, payout) with narrative (why it matters).\n5. **Log sources** – every insight gets a markdown bullet and URL so other agents can audit or refresh later.\n6. **Produce actionable output** – end each research session with:\n   - Snapshot summary (TL;DR).\n   - Risks / unknowns.\n   - Proposed next steps / tasks to add to roadmap.\n\n## Step-by-step Workflow\n1. **Frame** – write a 2–3 sentence research brief at the top of your notes (goal, context).\n2. **Seed terms** – list 5–8 keywords/phrases to search (e.g., “Gumroad fee structure 2025”, “AI toolkit marketplaces”).\n3. **Source sweep** – for each term:\n   - Use `search_repo`, `search_design_docs`, or external web context (if available) to gather links.\n   - Save metadata: URL, publish date, key quote/stat.\n4. **Evaluate** – score sources for credibility (official = high, forum = medium, random blog = low). Note contradictions.\n5. **Synthesize** – group insights under headings (Pricing, Requirements, Demand signals, Competitors).\n6. **Recommend** – convert findings into decisions or tasks (e.g., “Add Lemon Squeezy listing after Gumroad due to lower fee”).\n7. **Log** – drop summary + source list into `memory/notes.jsonl` (tags `research`, `stream:<id>`).\n\n## Prompt Template (for LLM agents)\n```\nYou are the Research & Development agent for God Mode.\nObjective: {goal}\nConstraints: {budget/time/market}\n\nFollow this loop:\n1. Restate the goal and list hypotheses.\n2. Draft search keywords.\n3. Gather sources (cite links + credibility).\n4. Summarize quantitative + qualitative insights.\n5. Recommend concrete next steps/tasks.\n\nOutput strictly in JSON:\n{\n  "goal": "...",\n  "hypotheses": [],\n  "sources": [{"url": "...", "credibility": "high/med/low", "summary": "..."}],\n  "insights": [{"category": "...", "details": "..."}],\n  "recommendations": []\n}\n```\n\nAgents must attach this JSON to their run log and add at least one summary note to memory for continuity.\n'}

This document defines the initial streams **B1–B4**, specifying their offers, audiences, traffic plans, supporting automations, and KPIs. Agents must read and update this plan before touching any funnel so changes remain coordinated across HUD, docs, and memory.\n\nThe existing HUD remains the canonical UI for surfacing stream KPIs and controls. If a new HUD is ever introduced, it must provide equivalent or better visibility before the old interface is deprecated.\n\n---\n\n## B1 – Affiliate / Digital Product Funnel\n\n**Type:** Affiliate promotion or internally produced digital product bundle  \n**Goal:** Generate fast cash flow with minimal infrastructure\n\n### Offer & Positioning\n- Curated “AI Growth Toolkit” (Notion templates, prompt packs, SOP checklists). Bundle can be swapped for an affiliate offer if better economics appear.\n- Price point: $37–$97 (or commission-based for affiliate).\n\n### Target Audience\n- Solopreneurs, creators, and agencies seeking AI leverage without deep technical skills.\n- Pain points: wasted time on manual content, uncertainty about AI workflows.\n\n### Traffic & Acquisition\n- Short-form content (TikTok, IG Reels, YT Shorts) highlighting quick wins.\n- Lead magnet optional: “5 prompts that add $1k/mo.”\n- CTA flows to landing page hosted within HUD/API or external checkout.\n\n### Funnel Experience\n1. Short-form post → Link-in-bio → Landing page.\n2. Landing page elements:\n   - Hero copy with succinct ROI promise.\n   - Video/social proof block (can be placeholder initially).\n   - CTA button with `affiliate_url` or internal checkout link.\n3.

Objective: Validate toolkit/course offer and spin up an owned audience quickly.\n2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8)** – Layer in B2 (seasonal spike) and B4 (service upsell). Objective: Diversify revenue sources and raise AOV.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Every code/doc change touching a funnel must reference this plan and update it if assumptions change.\n- Store experimental results in `memory/notes.jsonl` tagged with `stream:B1`, `stream:B2`, etc.\n- HUD stream detail pages should mirror the structure above so operators always know offer, audience, traffic, tasks, and KPIs.\n\n---\n\n## Continuous Optimization & Innovation (AUTOGEN Requirement)\n\nFor each stream, agents must:\n\n1. **Review performance weekly**: ledger data, HUD metrics, notes, and design docs.\n2. **Propose optimizations**: copy tweaks, new hooks, fresh traffic channels, pricing tests, UX improvements.\n3. **Document changes**: log rationale in `memory/notes.jsonl` and update this plan or stream-specific docs (`revenue_funnel_1.md`, `ecom_store_plan.md`, etc.).\n4. **Automate learnings**: when a tactic works, encode it into scripts or templates so future runs can reproduce the result instantly.\n\nWhen a major pivot occurs (e.g., switching the B1 offer), agents must:\n- Update HUD labels and documentation.\n- Archive or annotate deprecated assets to avoid confusion.\n- Ensure autopilot roadmap tasks reflect the new objectives.\n'}
