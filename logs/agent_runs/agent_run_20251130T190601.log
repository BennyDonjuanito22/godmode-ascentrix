=== NEW RUN 20251130T190601 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Pick a new market hypothesis, apply design_docs/research_agent_playbook.md workflow, log summary + sources in memory/notes.jsonl with tags ['research','practice'].

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (researcher): Gather and summarize context. Avoid repo edits unless essential; store insights via store_note.

TOOL_RESULT: {'content': '# Research Agent Playbook\n\nThis playbook tells every builder/researcher agent how to run due diligence, collect data, and translate findings into trusted tasks. Autopilot should reference this file before executing R&D tickets.\n\n## Core Principles\n1. **Define the question clearly** – restate the objective, success criteria, and constraints (budget, time, target persona).\n2. **Layered sourcing**:\n   - Primary: official docs, pricing pages, investor decks.\n   - Secondary: analyst blogs, comparison posts, community answers.\n   - Tertiary: social chatter (Twitter/Reddit) for qualitative signals.\n3. **Triangulate** – never trust a single link. Capture at least two corroborating sources for claims (fees, timelines, conversion data).\n4. **Quantify + qualify** – pair numbers (CAGR, CPM, payout) with narrative (why it matters).\n5. **Log sources** – every insight gets a markdown bullet and URL so other agents can audit or refresh later.\n6. **Produce actionable output** – end each research session with:\n   - Snapshot summary (TL;DR).\n   - Risks / unknowns.\n   - Proposed next steps / tasks to add to roadmap.\n\n## Step-by-step Workflow\n1. **Frame** – write a 2–3 sentence research brief at the top of your notes (goal, context).\n2. **Seed terms** – list 5–8 keywords/phrases to search (e.g., “Gumroad fee structure 2025”, “AI toolkit marketplaces”).\n3. **Source sweep** – for each term:\n   - Use `search_repo`, `search_design_docs`, or external web context (if available) to gather links.\n   - Save metadata: URL, publish date, key quote/stat.\n4. **Evaluate** – score sources for credibility (official = high, forum = medium, random blog = low). Note contradictions.\n5. **Synthesize** – group insights under headings (Pricing, Requirements, Demand signals, Competitors).\n6. **Recommend** – convert findings into decisions or tasks (e.g., “Add Lemon Squeezy listing after Gumroad due to lower fee”).\n7. **Log** – drop summary + source list into `memory/notes.jsonl` (tags `research`, `stream:<id>`).\n\n## Prompt Template (for LLM agents)\n```\nYou are the Research & Development agent for God Mode.\nObjective: {goal}\nConstraints: {budget/time/market}\n\nFollow this loop:\n1. Restate the goal and list hypotheses.\n2. Draft search keywords.\n3. Gather sources (cite links + credibility).\n4. Summarize quantitative + qualitative insights.\n5. Recommend concrete next steps/tasks.\n\nOutput strictly in JSON:\n{\n  "goal": "...",\n  "hypotheses": [],\n  "sources": [{"url": "...", "credibility": "high/med/low", "summary": "..."}],\n  "insights": [{"category": "...", "details": "..."}],\n  "recommendations": []\n}\n```\n\nAgents must attach this JSON to their run log and add at least one summary note to memory for continuity.\n'}
