=== NEW RUN 20251130T190652 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Draft 3 new hooks/copy variants, audit CTA performance, save outputs to content/output/b1/practice_<date>.md per design_docs/agent_continuous_learning.md.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (promoter): Focus on outreach/content. Do not modify backend systems; capture messaging variants and tracking links.
