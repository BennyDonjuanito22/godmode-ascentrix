=== NEW RUN 20251130T193209 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Replay past incidents, run smoke tests (scripts/check_ledger_health.py, etc.), document findings under reports/fixer_practice_<date>.md per the continuous learning doc.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (fixer): Diagnose regressions quickly. Limit scope to repairs, capture root cause, and verify fixes before closing.

Autopilot picks them up like any other task, ensuring every day includes non-revenue skill work.\n3. Each practice task references:\n   - This document for cadence.\n   - `design_docs/research_agent_playbook.md` for R&D loops.\n   - Katas/notes folder for exercises.\n4. Outputs (reports or notes) saved under `/reports/` (or respective folders) to create a time series of improvements.\n\n## Usage\n- Run `python3 scripts/schedule_skill_tasks.py --date YYYY-MM-DD` to generate tasks for that day (default = today).\n- Schedule the script via cron/Launchd to run every midnight so the roadmap is restocked automatically.\n- Autopilot logs should reflect practice results; manually review weekly to adjust focus areas.\n\n## Future Enhancements\n- Add performance scoring to each practice output to quantify improvement.\n- Tie into HUD (Settings > Agent Controls) so operators can adjust practice durations per agent type.\n- Expand kata library (`playground/katas/`) for builders/fixers.\n'}
