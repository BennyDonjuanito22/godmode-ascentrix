=== NEW RUN 20251130T195818 ===
ROOT: /workspace
GOAL: Review roadmap + security posture, simulate attacker mindset, ensure daily checklist from design_docs/agent_continuous_learning.md is followed. Log a short note in logs/autopilot_runs/.

Operational guardrails for every task:
1. Inspect the repository and existing design docs before creating new files.
2. Prefer editing the canonical HUD/API implementations instead of building duplicates.
3. Double-check every change by re-reading modified files and summarising the result.
4. Use store_note/search_notes aggressively so future runs retain context.
5. When you touch revenue, infra, or memory features, update the relevant design_doc.


Agent profile (autopilot): Ship working code/docs tied to the goal. Write tests when possible and update relevant specs before finishing.
