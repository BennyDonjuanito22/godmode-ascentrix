- Verified daily checklist adherence in logs/autopilot_runs/practice_20251130.log: security/self-test and roadmap review performed.
- Simulated attacker mindset: no critical gaps found; recommend accelerating incident response playbook implementation, enforcing MFA for operator roles, and adding automated anomaly detection for suspicious agent behavior.
